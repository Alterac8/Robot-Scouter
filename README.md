Robot Scouter is an open-source Android app that makes FIRST Robot scouting simple and collaborative.

Robot Scouter's main features:
  * No setup required
  * Easy sharing
  * Seamless collaboration: multiple people can scout the same team, different teams, or go solo on
 Android N and use split screen mode to scout several teams at once.
  * Customizable scouting templates with several different metrics to choose from:
    * true/false (checkbox)
    * number (counter)
    * list (selector)
    * text (notes)
  * Integration with [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com) to automatically populate team info
  * And more!
