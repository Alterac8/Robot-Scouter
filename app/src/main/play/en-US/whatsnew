- Spreadsheet exporting:
    - Exporting now works on pre-lollipop devices albeit using an older excel file format
    - Fix a crash when an export contains two teams with the same name
- Team icon now finds the latest uploaded picture from the last few years instead of relying on one static year
- If the same team is created while two devices are offline, a duplicate copy will be made and this option fixes that. To fix this, a new menu option enables merging those two teams back into one.
